#include <iostream>

// Function, named 'main', that returns a integer value.
int main() {
//    anything between the {} will be run when the main() is invoked by our function. This is called a CODE BLOCK. Each line of syntax is an instruction and these are completed from top to bottom.

    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; // cout = 'console out'
    std::cout << "My name is Charles." << std::endl; // endl = 'end line'

    std::cout << "   /|" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "  / |" << std::endl;
    std::cout << " /  |" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "/_ _|" << std::endl;

//    this terminate the main() function
    return 0;
